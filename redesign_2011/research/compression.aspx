<h1> Compression Research</h1>
<p>
Dr. Jin Li started his research career in Multimedia Compression. His noteworthy contribution are
related to image/video/audio compression standard, include:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="../publication/1999/rd_optimization.aspx">Operational rate-distortion (R-D) 
optimality in embedded coding and sub-bitplane scanning</a> (incorporated into JPEG 2000).
</li>
<li> <a href="../publication/1999/vip.aspx">Visual weighting and visual progressive compression </a> 
(incorporated into JPEG 2000)</li>
<li> <a href="../publication/2001/mclift.aspx"> Motion Compensated Lifting (a.k.a., Motion compensated temporal filtering)
</a> (incorporated into H.264/SVC) </li>
<li> <a href="../publication/2002/jpip.aspx"> JPEG Interactive Protocol (JPIP) </a>" 
(incorporated into JPEG 2000, Part 9)</li>
<li> <a href="../publication/1998/aswp.aspx"> Arbitrary shape wavelet transform with phase alignment </a>" 
(incorporated into MPEG 4, shape adaptive wavelet coding )</li>
<li> <a href="../publication/2003/mvc.aspx"> Multiview Image Compression (pioneer work that leads to H.264 MVC)</a></li>
<li> <a href="../publication/2004/saudio.aspx"> Scalable audio coding </a>
( incorporated into MPEG 4, audio lossless format )</li>
</ol>

<p>
In his early 
career, he has implemented
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1">MPEG-1</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG">JBIG</a>, thereby gained hand-on knowledge of the inner working of the compression 
standards. He has won the best Ph.D. thesis award at Tsinghua University in 
1994, for his work on <a href="../publication/1993/1993_multires_tree.pdf">variable block size motion 
compensation</a> and a semi-object based video compression algorithm that 
significantly improves the performance of motion compensation for MPEG-1.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>From 1994-1996, Dr. Li joined <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">Univ. of Southern 
California</a>, in the <a href="http://viola.usc.edu/People/cckuo/">Media 
Communications Lab of Prof. C.-C. Jay Kuo</a>. From 1996-1999, he has joined
<a href="http://www.sharplabs.com/">Sharp Labs of America</a> (SLA), and has 
represented the interest of SLA in <a href="http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/">JPEG 
2000</a> and <a href="http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-4/mpeg-4.htm">
MPEG-4</a> standard activity. 
He joined Microsoft in 1999, first at Microsoft Research Asia(MSRA) (he has won a 
Microsoft gold star award  in 2000 for his contribution in founding MSRA), and moved
to Microsoft Research Redmond in 2001.  
He has worked on 
<a href="../publication/1999/fractal_wavelet.aspx">Fractal compression</a>, 
<a href="../publication/1997/csvt97aug_ratecontrol.pdf">video rate 
control</a>, <a href="../publication/1997/icip97_postproc.pdf">coding artifect removal</a>,
<a href="../publication/1996/aero96_mwt.pdf">vector wavelet</a>, 
<a href="../publication/1997/vcip97_wp.pdf">wavelet packet</a>, etc..
