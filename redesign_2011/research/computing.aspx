<h1> <a href="http://msrccs.github.io/Prajna/"> Prajna: Cloud Service and Interactive Big Data Analytics </a> </h1>

<p>
		Dr. Li's latest passion is <a href="computing.aspx">Prajna</a>, a distributed 
		computing platform. Prajna is developed echoing the call for Microsoft 
		to be the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and 
		cloud-first world. It fills the void of real-time big data computing on 
		.Net platform. Prajna is open sourced at
		<a href="https://github.com/msrccs/Prajna/">
		https://github.com/msrccs/Prajna/</a>. It is designed to be a generic 
		distributed computing platform, with core functionality being the 
		execution of an arbitrary closure (C#, F#, native code, etc.) on any 
		remote node, in public cloud or in private cluster. It supports 
		interactive big data computing across a cluster with in-memory 
		computation. The programming API is similar to Spark. Prajna has also a 
		managed web service (Prajna Hub), which can help developer to quickly 
		prototype and host cloud service and run services on mobile Apps. Prajna 
		also supports distributed machine learning (e.g., distributed neural 
		network trainer using Caffe on each node). Please find more information at:
