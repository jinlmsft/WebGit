Motion Compensated Lifting (called Motion Compensated Temporal Filtering in 
H.264). 
</p>

<p>
Dr. Li pioneered motion compensated temporal filtering, in which wavelet decomposition in 
the temporal direction is applied in hierarchical B-frame fashion. This technology 
integrates motion compensation into temporal wavelet direction, and is fundamental to 
maintaining high quality while scaling the video over a large range of bit rates.  
</p>
<p>
The work has been incorporated into the H.264/SVC video coding standard in the name of 
motion compensated temporal filtering. </p>
