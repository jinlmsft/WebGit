Fig. 1. Rate-distortion optimization for embedded coding.

<p>

This 
is the definitive work that established the methodology to achieve operational 
rate-distortion (R-D) optimality in scalable media coding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; 
It is shown that by allocating the available coding bits first to the cofficient 
with the steepest R-D slope, i.e., the largest distortion decrease per coding 
bit spent, the resultant coding bitstream can be truncated at any point and 
still maintain an optimal R-D performance. </span>The insight is that going 
beyond bitplane scanning (which separates bits in the same bitplane into 
significance bits and refinement bits) can provide significant coding gain in 
scalable coding by sequencing the bits in the correct order according to their 
rate distortion performance. The sub-bitplane optimization is a fundamental technology adopted by the ISO JPEG 2000 image coding standard.
