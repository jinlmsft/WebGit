Dr. Li has studied the content delivery infrastructure of today's Internet. Together with 
his colleague, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~chengh">Cheng Huang</a>, 
they have developed a 
number of technologies to study and quantify the performance of the current Internet 
infrastructure performance and content delivery network (CDN) provider performance, and 
have proposed enhancement of the existing solutions.
