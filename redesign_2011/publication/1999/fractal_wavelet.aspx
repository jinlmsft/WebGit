	Fig. 1. The contractive mapping operation in fractal compression can be 
	carried out via an equivalent fashion in the wavelet domain, by predicting 
	coefficients of the higher resolution from those of the lower resolution 
	(with possible linear scaling and rotation operators).</p>

Fractal compression receives great attension in 1990s. Rather than directly encoding the image 
content, fractal compression uses the contractive mapping to represent an image.

This work shows that the fractal contractive mapping could be considered as a prediction 
operation in the wavelet domain. That is, the contractive mapping in the fractal compression operation
can be equivalent considered as predicting coefficients of the higher resolution from those of the
lower resolution. It establishes the link between fractal compression and wavelet.
